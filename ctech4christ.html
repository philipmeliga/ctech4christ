        <p>The world today is becoming extremely reliant on advances in technology. Virtually all spheres of life, including religion, education, business, arts & entertainment, media etc., have harnessed the enormous possibilities provided by Information Technology (IT).</p> 
        <p>The kingdom of God, however must not be left behind in this development as appropriate application of technology can be a powerful tool in the advancement of God's kingdom.</p>
        <p>Negative influences of technology have also been evident in the society today, sponsored by the devil and his demons, such as promoting false spiritual teachings online, using social media to promote conflicts, popularizing pornography using the internet etc. These highlight the need for more kingdom people with profound technological skills to rise and take centre stage in the world of technology. More gadgets, more apps and more electronic devices need to be built that can facilitate the propelling of the gospel.Believers are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14).  </p>
        <h4>Current Developments</h4>
       <p>Current developments in Information Technology in terms of advancing God's kingdom include:</p>
